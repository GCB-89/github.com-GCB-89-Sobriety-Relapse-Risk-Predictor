ðŸ§  Relapse Risk Prediction: Data Preparation and Modeling
This notebook walks through a complete pipeline for predicting relapse risk using SAMHSA survey data. It includes:

ðŸ“¥ Data loading & cleaning

ðŸ§ª Feature engineering (including simulation for missing data)

ðŸ“Š Relapse risk scoring based on health, behavioral, and social indicators

ðŸ¤– Model training using a decision tree classifier

ðŸ“ˆ Model evaluation & visualization of risk levels and key predictors

The goal is to provide actionable insights into which factors most strongly influence relapse riskâ€”helping target support for individuals at highest need.
