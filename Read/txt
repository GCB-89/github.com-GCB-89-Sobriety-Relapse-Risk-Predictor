This project uses real survey data to predict an individual’s risk of relapse into substance use based on emotional, behavioral, and recovery-related indicators.

🔍 Project Purpose
Help counselors identify clients at High, Medium, or Low relapse risk using key factors like:

Self-rated well-being

Past treatment history

Doctor-advised treatment

Current recovery status

📁 What's Inside
File	Description
relapse_predictor.ipynb	Main notebook: loads data, trains model, and visualizes predictions
NSDUH_2023_Tab.txt	Dataset (subset from national health survey)
README.md	This file
(Optional) charts/	Contains saved graphs and decision trees

⚙️ How It Works
Clean and filter the NSDUH dataset for recovery-relevant features

Assign relapse risk levels based on scoring + patterns in the data

Train a decision tree model

Input client data via counselor interface

View relapse risk prediction & helpful visuals

👤 For Counselors
Scroll to the Counselor Prediction Interface section in the notebook to:

Enter basic health and recovery indicators

Instantly view a relapse risk label + visual risk meter

📈 Visuals Include:
Feature importance charts

Decision tree for transparency

Risk-level gauge plot for client review

✅ Requirements
Python 3.10+

pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

(Optional) Graphviz for detailed tree visualizations
